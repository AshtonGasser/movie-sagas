I have a movie list using react, redux saga, sql . 
you can add movie to the database by clicking the add movie button. clicking the add movie button will take you to the add movie page . there you can insert movie information and upload a poster . clicking save will post your info to the database . clicking cancel will clear the info and take you back to the main page. when you click on a poster in the main page it will take you to the details page. there you will see the movie Title, description, and the genre displayed from the data table. clicking back to movies will take you back to the main page. 

this client side will soon be updated to contain more styling with material ui
